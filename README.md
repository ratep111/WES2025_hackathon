# üö® WES2025 Hackathon ‚Äì Embedded Infotainment System

**Team #4 - Firma/Depwesija**
- **Majda Bakmaz**
- **Luka Bradaric-Lisic**
- **Petar Jakus**
- **Jakov Jovic**

A modular, embedded infotainment and monitoring system designed for **emergency vehicles** such as ambulances, firetrucks, and police units.  
Built with **ESP-IDF**, **FreeRTOS**, and **LVGL**, this system integrates with onboard sensors to provide real-time feedback, environmental monitoring, and user-friendly interaction through a touch display.

## üõ† Getting Started

> Requires **ESP-IDF v5.0.2**

### üß∞ Project Initialization

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
./project_init.sh
```

This will:

- Initialize Git submodules
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Patch ESP-IDF drivers (if needed)
- Check and install `clang-format`
- Load recommended `sdkconfig` for the BLDK devkit

---

### üî® Build + Flash

To compile the project:

```bash
idf.py build
```

To flash and monitor:

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

## üß© Modular Component System

All sensors and logic are implemented as **modular components** in `components/`.

For a full list of available modules, their GPIOs, and capabilities, check:  
üìÑ [`components/README.md`](components/README.md)

## üîå Hardware Platform

- **ESP32 WROVER module**
- Custom baseboard with:
  - TCRT5000 IR reflective sensors (door)
  - VEML7700 ambient light sensor
  - LIS2DH12TR SPI accelerometer
  - HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
  - PCF8523 RTC with CR1220 backup
  - SHT3x-DIS temperature & humidity sensor
  - Buzzer + 3x LED indicators
  - Push buttons and joystick
  - 2.4" or 3.5" TFT display (LVGL-ready)
